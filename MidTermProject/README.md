# MidTermProject 

First, I searched articles where interesting Kaggle datasets are described. 
I was thinking about some biological data since I'm a bioinformatician. 
However, trying something completely new might be a really good idea too. 

Since I love dogs and I have one, I decided to go with Kaggle 'animal-behavior-analysis' (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/animal-behavior-analysis?resource=download). 

Here is my dog, btw. Here name is Caoimhe.
