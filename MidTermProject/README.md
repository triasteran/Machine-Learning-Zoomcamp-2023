# MidTermProject: classification of tumour types using gene expression data  

First, I searched articles where interesting Kaggle datasets are described. 
I was thinking about some biological data since I'm a bioinformatician. 
I decided to go with Dataset GSE9476 (raw microarray data: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE9476) on leukemia gene expression from CuMiDa (https://sbcb.inf.ufrgs.br/cumida). 

Structure of the repository is following: 
* README.md
* notebook.ipynb
* train.py
* predict.py
* conda_env.yml
* Dockerfile

ML model is organised in a following framework:

## Description of the problem

Imagine that you're tasked with ... 
You need to predict ... using data collected from  ... 

## Instructions on how to run the project

Here I'll talk about preparation of the environment for training and using the model 

On a completely unrelated topic, here is my dog. Here name is Caoimhe.
